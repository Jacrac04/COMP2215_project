# Time-Based Remote Server Shutdown Controller

## üìò Project Overview

Recently I switched out my Raspberry pi home server for some old PCs. During setup and testing, they are running in my bedroom, so each night I had to turn them of and restart them the following morning. However this lead to a problem, as A student often running late I would forget to turn them on before I left then wouldn't be able to access files on them all day while on campus. So I decided to build a small microcontroller based system that would allow me to set a time for the server to turn on and off automatically.

## üöÄ My Solution

To solve this, I‚Äôve built a **Raspberry Pi Pico W based system** running MicroPython that:
- Connects to WiFi Network
- Syncs time with an NTP server
- Hosts a small web server where you can add servers
- Each server has a wake/sleep time
- Periodically checks the current time
- Sends an HTTP POST request to a specific endpoint to **shut down the old PCs remotely** when it‚Äôs past the defined sleep time
- Pulses a GPIO pin to "press" the power button on the PCs
- Display to show simple information
- Buttons to change what the display shows

## üß† How It Works

- **WiFi Setup**: The board connects to the local network using credentials defined in the code.
- **Time Syncing**: NTP is used to get the current time.
- **Web Interface**: A web server lets you add servers and set their wake/sleep times.
- **Scheduler Logic**: At a changeable set interval, the microcontroller checks the current time and compares it to user-defined ranges.
- **Shutdown Trigger**: When the current time is past the defined *sleep time*, it sends a shutdown request via HTTP to the server, waits, and then pulses a GPIO pin to simulate pressing the power button on the PC.
- **Display**: A small OLED display shows the IP address of the board and the current time. You can cycle through different servers using buttons to see their status and wake/sleep times.
- **Power Button Simulation**: GPIO pins is pulsed to simulate pressing the power button on the PC.

## üîß Requirements

- Microcontroller with WiFi (ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico W)
- MicroPython firmware
- A server that exposes a shutdown endpoint (e.g., `/shutdown` route with bearer token)

## üåê Server Shutdown Endpoint

This project assumes your server listens for a POST request like so:

```
POST http://myserver.com/shutdown
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

You‚Äôll need to set this up on the server-side to actually shut the machine down (e.g., via a small Flask app, shell script, etc.).

## üí° Future Plans

The original idea for this project was to write this in C but I started with MicroPython to test out the concept. However as I started to work on the C version, I very quickly got stuck and ran out of time.

It would also be good to add persistent storage to save the server list and their wake/sleep times, so they are not lost when the board is powered off. This could be done using a small EEPROM or flash memory.

Also adding a system settings page to change settings like display sleep and the time interval for checking the server status would be useful.

## üì¶ Hardware Requirement
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- 1.3" OLED Display
- Opto-coupler to simulate the power button press

I chose to use an opto-coupler rather than connect the two circuits while still allowing the GPIO pin to control the power button.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
project_main.py           # MicroPython script to run on the board

project_simple_main.py    # Simplified version of the main script, designed to base the C version off
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Modify the following variables in the script:

```python
SSID = 'your_wifi_ssid'
PASSWORD = 'your_wifi_password'

```

Replace the URL and token in `shut_server_down()` with your actual shutdown endpoint:

```python
url = "http://myserver.com/shutdown"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

## üíª Code Breakdown

- **OLED_1inch3 Class**: Handles the OLED display. This is directly from the [Waveshare Example Code](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-OLED-1.3).
- **Server Class**: Represents a server with its wake/sleep times and methods to check if it should be shut down and methods associated with the server.
- **WebServer Class**: Responsible for running the webserver and handling incoming requests.
- **Server_Manager**: Manages the list of servers and their states.
- **OLED_Manager**: Responsible display pages, transitioning between them, and updating the display with the current time and server information.
- **Button_Handler**: Handles button presses to cycle through the display pages.
- **sync_time function**: Syncs the time with an NTP server.
- **webserver thread**: Runs the web server in a separate thread.
- **main loop**: Periodically gets the current time and calls all the update methods for the servers, server manager, OLED manager, and button handler.
